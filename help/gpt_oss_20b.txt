            "top_k": 50,
            "repeat_penalty": 1.1,
            "context_length": 4096  # Utilize large context
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, timeout=600)  # 10 minute timeout
    return response.json()["response"]

Streaming for Long Responses:
----------------------------
import requests
import json

def stream_gpt_oss_response(prompt):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate"
    data = {
        "model": "gpt-oss:20b",
        "prompt": prompt,
        "stream": True
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, stream=True, timeout=600)
    
    print("Response (streaming):")
    for line in response.iter_lines():
        if line:
            chunk = json.loads(line)
            if 'response' in chunk:
                print(chunk['response'], end='', flush=True)
            if chunk.get('done', False):
                break
    print("\n")

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
========================
‚Ä¢ Use streaming for long responses to see progress
