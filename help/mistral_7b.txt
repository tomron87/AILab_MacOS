PYTHON USAGE EXAMPLES:
======================

Basic Usage:
-----------
import requests

def query_mistral(prompt, model="mistral:7b"):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate"
    data = {
        "model": model,
        "prompt": prompt,
        "stream": False
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, timeout=120)
    return response.json()["response"]

# Example usage
response = query_mistral("Explain machine learning in French")
print(response)

Multilingual Example:
--------------------
def multilingual_query(prompt, language="English"):
    system_prompt = f"Please respond in {language}. Be accurate and helpful."
    full_prompt = f"{system_prompt}\n\n{prompt}"
    
    return query_mistral(full_prompt)

# Examples in different languages
french_response = multilingual_query("What is artificial intelligence?", "French")
spanish_response = multilingual_query("What is artificial intelligence?", "Spanish")
german_response = multilingual_query("What is artificial intelligence?", "German")

Mathematical Reasoning:
----------------------
math_prompt = """
Solve this step by step:
A train travels 120 km in 2 hours. If it increases its speed by 20 km/h,
how long will it take to travel 180 km?
Show all calculations.
"""

math_response = query_mistral(math_prompt)
print("Mathematical Solution:")
print(math_response)

Code Generation Example:
-----------------------
code_prompt = """
Create a Python class for a simple bank account with the following features:
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with balance check)
- Check balance
- Transaction history
Include proper error handling and documentation.
"""

code_response = query_mistral(code_prompt)
print("Generated Code:")
print(code_response)

Advanced Configuration:
----------------------
def query_mistral_advanced(prompt, temperature=0.7, max_tokens=1000):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate"
    data = {
        "model": "mistral:7b",
        "prompt": prompt,
        "stream": False,
        "options": {
            "temperature": temperature,
            "num_predict": max_tokens,
            "top_p": 0.9,
            "top_k": 40,
            "repeat_penalty": 1.1
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, timeout=180)
    return response.json()["response"]

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
========================
‚Ä¢ Use temperature 0.1-0.4 for factual/mathematical tasks
‚Ä¢ Use temperature 0.6-0.8 for creative tasks
‚Ä¢ Adjust repeat_penalty (1.0-1.2) to reduce repetition
‚Ä¢ Use streaming for long responses
‚Ä¢ Optimal top_p: 0.9, top_k: 40

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
===================
Minimum RAM: 8 GB
Recommended RAM: 12 GB
Storage: 5 GB free space
CPU: Modern multi-core processor
GPU: Optional but recommended for faster inference

PROMPT ENGINEERING TIPS:
========================
‚Ä¢ Be specific about the desired language for responses
‚Ä¢ Use clear, structured prompts for best results
‚Ä¢ Specify output format when needed
‚Ä¢ For math problems, ask for step-by-step solutions
‚Ä¢ Use system prompts for consistent behavior

Example System Prompt:
---------------------
system_prompt = """
You are a helpful AI assistant that provides accurate and detailed responses.
Always show your reasoning for mathematical problems and cite sources when possible.
Respond in the language requested by the user.
"""

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
Q: Model loads slowly?
A: Normal due to size, first load takes 1-2 minutes

Q: Responses in wrong language?
A: Be explicit about language in your prompt

Q: Mathematical errors?
A: Ask for step-by-step solutions and verification

Q: Code doesn't work?
A: Request testing and error handling in the prompt

Q: Repetitive responses?
A: Increase repeat_penalty parameter (1.1-1.2)

COMPARISON WITH OTHER MODELS:
============================
vs Llama2 7B: More efficient, better multilingual, similar general capability
